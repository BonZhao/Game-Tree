Above all I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Vincenzo Liberatre, for his assistance through the entire process of
creating this thesis topic and finishing this research. At the beginning of this thesis I knew very little of the process of research, but Professor Liberatre provided advice and suggestion which helped me find a way to begin the experiment. Whenever I met problems, he guided me to out of stuck with patience. It is impossible to complete this thesis without him.

I also would like to express my thanks to my parents. During my first 24 years of life, they tried their best to support my life and study, and I even didn't acknowledge this for a long time. Their love and support is the reason I could be here.
